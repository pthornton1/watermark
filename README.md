Currently a basic version of adding a watermark to an image, with the option of using a image or text as a watermark.

Requires better support to save the created image as the current version only saves a low resolution format compared to the original.

Also there are many obvious ways this could be made customisable eg. allowing user to move or rotate watermark or change color of text etc.

Requires installation of ghostscript which can be downloaded from the website or via Homebrew on Mac
